# Plückertree - Fast nearest neighbouring line lookup

This is the code written for my master thesis with the dutch title "Plückerbomen: efficiënt zoeken van k dichtstbijzijnde rechten rond punt in 3D, met toepassing in photonmapping". (in english: "Plückertrees: efficient search of k nearest lines around point in 3D, with application in photonmapping")

This is research code, so definitely not production ready.
You can find the PDF of my thesis [here](Thesis.pdf).
